  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures"
    - reliability: A
    - security: A
    - maintainability: A

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
    - In general our estimations were pretty accurate, in fact our task estimation error ratio is just 1.02; the worst estimation was on the first story, because we overestimated by around 4 hrs.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
    - We spent more time on tests than in the prevoius project, but still not enough (only 47 % coverage). 
    - We experimented with new technologies to make the project better, as opposed to sticking with what we know. For example with the process of automatically sending out emails.

- Feedback improvements from the previous sprint: 
    - Suggestion on the GUI
    - More data shown on the student list
    - Adding confimation dialog for booking and canceling the booking 

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
    - Prioritize stories over issue based on visual upgrades
    - Code documentation improvements 

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

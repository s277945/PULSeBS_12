| _#11_  |    5     |    34 | 6h 30m     | 7h 22m       |


- Hours per task (average, standard deviation):
    - Average: 6.2 hrs per task
    - Standard deviation: 2.86 hrs

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent from previous table:
    -  83 / 80.50 =  1.03

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
    - We faced with some understimation of dependences between stories 

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
    - not keeping good code documentation may lead people trying to fix/change things to lose time
    
- Feedback improvements from the previous sprint: 
    - Suggestion on the GUI
    - More data shown on the student list
    - Adding confimation dialog for booking and canceling the booking 

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
    - Prioritize stories over issue based on visual upgrades
    - Code documentation improvements 

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
    - fast stakeholder issue solving

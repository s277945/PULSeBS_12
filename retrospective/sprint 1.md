## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
    - In general our estimations were pretty accurate, in fact our task estimation error ratio is just 1.03
	
- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
    - We spent more time in the beginning to carefully design the database, so that we didn't need to modify the db schema during the sprint.

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?


- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
     - Better time estimation
     - Distribution of the working hours per week
     - Communication issue in team

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

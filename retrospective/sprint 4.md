### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#18_  |    7    |    3   | 4h 45m     |  3h 46m      |
| _#19_  |    3    |    1   |    2h      |  2h          |
| _#20_  |     5   |    8   | 10h 40m    |     8h 35m   |
| _#21_  |     1   |    5   |      20m   |       20m    |

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation):
    - Average:  5.5 hrs
    - Standard deviation: 3.75 hrs

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent from previous table:
    -  84 / 78 =  1.07

  - Total hours estimated: 6h
  - Total hours spent: 6h 30m
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 168 
  - Coverage (overall): 96.6%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 7h
  - Total hours spent 8h
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 40m
  - Total hours spent: 20m
- Technical Debt management
  - Total hours estimated: 1h 30m
  - Total hours spent: 3h 12m
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube: 1h 15m
  - Hours spent on remediation: 1h 20m
  - debt ratio: 0.0%
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures"
    - reliability: A
    - security: A
    - maintainability: A

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
    - unexpected long code implementation for tasks with teacher/student tutorials 
    - bugs fixing 

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
    - by setting final deadlines for ready demo version at least 1 scrum meeting before oficial demo presentation - we were able to check the whole project, improve some parts and achieve our goal with clear and improved code 
    - sometimes a will to use complicated example of code implementation requires more detailed knowledges about that, so it can take more time than estimated and this has to be taken into account (and bug fixing too)
    
    
- Stakeholder feedback improvements from the previous sprint:
    - Reset a checkbox selection after each successful change
    - Change text colour for support officer page
    - Fix buttons on support officer page 
  
- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?    
    - We planned better when should be ready all the stories for this sprint, so we had extra time for testing and bug fixing

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
     - None
     
- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
     - This sprint is our last sprint for this course, so we can't say what exactly should be improved for now, but considering it as an ongoing project we would like to plan some additional time to research (learn) some experienced examples of code implementations, so we can implement them in our work
     - Considering a little bit more time for bug fixing when we are implementing new components

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
    - After each finished sprint and demo presentation we were doing really detailed reflection about What and How we did, which project goal we want to achieve at the end of the course, so it helped us to plan better next sprint process and that's how we avoided misunderstandings in team communication and work

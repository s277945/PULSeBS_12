## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
    - In general our estimations were pretty accurate, in fact our task estimation error ratio is just 1.02; the worst estimation was on the first story, because we overestimated by around 4 hrs.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
    - We spent more time on tests than in the prevoius project, but still not enough (only 47 % coverage). 
    - We experimented with new technologies to make the project better, as opposed to sticking with what we know. For example with the process of automatically sending out emails.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
    - We spent more time in the beginning to carefully design the database, so that we didn't need to modify the db schema during the sprint.
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
     - We feel like we got better at logging our work, but still we weren't precise enough: for example, we didn't separately log time spent on code review.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
     - Better time estimation
     - Distribution of the working hours per week
     - Communication issue in team

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
    - We were able to deliver a stable and working product in a short time.
